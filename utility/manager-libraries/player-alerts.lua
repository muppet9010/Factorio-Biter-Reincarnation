--[[
    Library to support using player alerts that handles all of the complicated edge cases for applying alerts to forces.
    Force alerts apply to all players currently on the force and the library automatically handles new players joining a force, players changing forces and forces being merged.
    This library is used by calling the RegisterPlayerAlerts() function once in root of control.lua. With the public functions then being called as required to add and remove alerts.
